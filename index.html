<p>MSCViewer is a tool for visualization and analysis of message sequence charts. Simply put, the tool loads a text file with a subset of lines in written in 
a simple JSON format, and creates a sequence diagram model out of it. The user can navigate the model interactively, or even write Python script to analyze it.</p>

<p>The tool is extremely useful for visualization and interactive analysis of execution traces/logs for systems with a large number of cooperating 
entities (processes, threads, etc.). By interactive we mean the tool doesn't produce a static picture of a sequence diagram: the user can interactively
open as many entities as desired, sort them in the preferred order, search on events and interactions, filter undesired elements from the view, etc. 
Of course, if desired the user can also create a PNG capture of the current diagram. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/rattias/mscviewer/blob/master/doc/openstack_example.png">screen capture</a> shows, for example, the use of MSCViewer in the context
of OpenStack.</p>

<p>MSCViewer can also be used to create sequence diagrams for documentation, by simply typing the model for the desired diagram in a text editor.</p>

<p>The real power of MSCViewer though comes from the integration with a Python engine. Through this, the user can write python scripts to navigate 
the model. This opens a world of possibilities, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flow-based Automated Testing: scripts can test that the trace produce by a system contains certain distributed computational flows, and that
such flows are operating as expected</li>
<li>Ability to create custom graphs from the data in the model</li>
</ul>

<a id="binary-release" class="anchor" href="#binary-release" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Binary Release</h3>

<p>While MSCViewer is opensource, if you want to save yourself the hassle of building you can pick up a prebuilt release in your favorite archive format:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rattias/mscviewer/releases/download/v2.0Beta2/mscviewer_2.0B2.tgz">tar.gz archive</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rattias/mscviewer/releases/download/v2.0Beta2/mscviewer_2.0B2.tgz">zip archive</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Just uncompress it in any directory, and run the <em>bin/mscviewer</em>. For your convenience some example input files are provided in the <em>examples</em> directory.</p>
