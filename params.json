Simply put, the tool loads a text file with a subset of lines in written in a simple JSON format, and creates a sequence diagram model out of it. The user can navigate the model interactively, or even write Python script to analyze it.\r\n\r\n### Applications\r\nThe tool is extremely useful for visualization and analysis of execution traces/logs for systems with a large number of interactive entities (processes, threads, etc.). \r\n\r\nAn example in the context of OpenStack can be seen in this [screen capture](https://github.com/rattias/mscviewer/blob/master/doc/openstack_example.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
