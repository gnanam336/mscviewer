<ul>
    <li> added Python integration. Python scripts can now be written to interact with the model and GUI.</li>
    <li> implemented graph topology sorting. Upon loading, events are reordered to respect causality, even
         when timestamps end up out-of-order.         
    <li> added 'x' button to entity header for quick close</li>
    <li> added "_" button to entity header to shrink columns</li>
    <li> when a column is selected now the "+" and "-" keys increase/reduce the width of the selected column only</li>
    <li> double-clicking on blue lines in the source view now causes the associated entity to be opened in the 
         sequence diagram, if it wasn't already.</li>
    <li> added list in bottom right corner showing opened entities. Entities can be closed by 
         selecting and pressing return. Multiple entities can be selected using SHIFT (range)
         or CTRL keys while clicking. Selection of entity in this list causes the
         graph view to scroll to make the entity visible.</li> 
    <li> Entities in entity tree not having any event are now shown in gray, and can't be
         opened any longer.</li>                 
    <li> added help menu and 'about' item</li>
